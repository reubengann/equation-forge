1.  `x_{n + 1} = x_{n} + \frac{\left(a + b\right)}{2} \Delta t`
    Should allow moving (multiplicative) \Delta t into the fraction, but since it's two terms, this cannot be done

2.  `\frac{a}{b} = \frac{\left(c + d\right)}{e}`
    Should be able to move the b multiplicatively to the RHS. Preview says it's allowed, but when you drop, nothing happens.

3.  `c=\left(a b\right)`
    Preview says we can move b outside the parentheses, but when dropping nothing happens.

4.  `a \left(b c d\right) = e`
    Select both c and d. Dragging the multi-selection out of the parentheses to the LHS does not work (no preview, no execution). Dragging onto the RHS generates a preview, but when executed, incorrectly moves all of b c d to the RHS, resulting in
    `a \left(1\right) = \frac{1}{b c d} e`, which is not desired.

5.  `2 x_2 - x_1`
    if we substitute `x_2` `a+b`, we expect `2 (a+b) - x_1`, but instead we get `2 a + b - x_1`, which is incorrect.

6.  P = \frac{R T}{\left(v - b\right)} - \frac{a}{v^{2}}
    apply eqn\*v
    P v = \frac{R T}{\left(v - b\right)} - \frac{a}{v^{2}} v
    This is wrong. It didn't apply to both terms on the rhs

7.  Find a way to represent functions. (a(t))^2 should not expand to a^2 t^2. Maybe via right-click menu
